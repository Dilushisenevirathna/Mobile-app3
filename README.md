Node.js CRUD Operations with Express.js and MongoDB

Introduction

The purpose of this project is to learn how to create a Restful CRUD API with Node.js, Express, 
and MongoDB. The project involves creating a set of APIs that will allow me to manage the 
inventory of our rubber factory's store in specific grades. The API will allow us to create, read, 
update, and delete data from the store's inventory database.

Methodology
I used the following tools and technologies to create the Restful CRUD API:

Node.js
This is a JavaScript runtime that allows me to run JavaScript on the server side. I used Node.js 
to create the server that will host my API.

Express
This is a web application framework for Node.js. I used Express to create the API endpoints 
and to handle HTTP requests.

MongoDB
This is a NoSQL database that I used to store the data for our API.

Insomnia
This is a popular REST client that can be used to test and debug APIs. It allows developers to 
send HTTP requests to an API and view the responses in a user-friendly interface. In the context 
of this project, Insomnia can be used to test the Restful CRUD API created with Node.js, 
Express, and MongoDB.

With Insomnia, developers can create HTTP requests for each of the API endpoints and view 
the responses from the server. This makes it easy to test the API and ensure it works correctly. 
Insomnia also allows developers to save and organize their HTTP requests, making it easy to 
reuse them in future testing sessions.

In addition to testing the API, Insomnia can be used to debug any issues that may arise during 
development. If an API endpoint is not responding as expected, developers can use Insomnia 
to view the request and response details and identify any errors or issues.
Overall, Insomnia is a powerful tool that can be used to streamline the development process 
and ensure that the Restful CRUD API created with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB is 
working correctly. It is a valuable tool for any developer working with APIs and can help to 
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of API development.

Steps to create the API

1. installed Node.js and MongoDB on my local machines.
2. created a new Node.js project and installed the necessary dependencies, including 
Express and the MongoDB driver.
3. created a MongoDB database and collection to store the inventory data.
4. created the API endpoints for the CRUD operations: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
5. tested the API using Insomnia, a popular tool for testing APIs.

Results

I am able to create a fully functional Restful CRUD API for managing the inventory of the 
Rubber factory's store in specific grades. The API allows me to create new inventory items, 
retrieve existing items, update existing items, and delete items from the database.

Conclusion

Creating a Restful CRUD API with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB is a relatively 
straightforward process. By following the steps outlined in this project, I am able to create a 
fully functional API that can be used to manage the inventory of the Rubber factory's store. 
This project can be a useful starting point for anyone who wants to learn how to create APIs 
with these technologies.
